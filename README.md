`react-native-fitness` is a library that works on both `iOS` and `Android` with it you can interact with Apple Healthkit and Google Fit.
Currently the lib provides a set of [API](#API) that you can use to read steps count or distance count for a given period of time.

Note:
We're open to receive PRs that contains new features or improvements, so feel free to contribute to this repo.

## Getting started

`npm install @ovalmoney/react-native-fitness --save`

or

`yarn add @ovalmoney/react-native-fitness`

### Mostly automatic installation

`react-native link @ovalmoney/react-native-fitness`

### Manual installation


#### iOS

### Pods
1. Add the line below to your `Podfile`.
    ```pod
    pod 'react-native-fitness', :path => '../node_modules/@ovalmoney/react-native-fitness'`
    ```
2. Run `pod install` in your iOS project directory.
3. In XCode, select your project, go to `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries` and add `libreact-native-fitness.a`.
4. Add following to your `Info.plist` in order to ask permissions.
    ```xml
    <key>NSHealthShareUsageDescription</key>
    <string>Read and understand health data.</string>
    ```

### Manually

1. In XCode's project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`
2. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `@ovalmoney` ➜ `react-native-fitness` and select `RNFitness.xcodeproj`
3. In XCode select your project, go to `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries` and add `libRNFitness.a`.
4. Run your project (`Cmd+R`)

In order to make it run, it is necessary to turn on `Health Kit` in the `Capabilities`.

#### Android
1. Get an OAuth 2.0 Client ID as explained at https://developers.google.com/fit/android/get-api-key
2. Open up `MainApplication.java`
    - Add `import com.ovalmoney.fitness.RNFitnessPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
    - Add `new RNFitnessPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method
3. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:
  	```java
  	include ':@ovalmoney_react-native-fitness'
  	project(':@ovalmoney_react-native-fitness').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, 	'../node_modules/@ovalmoney/react-native-fitness/android')
  	```
4. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:
  	```java
    compile project(':@ovalmoney_react-native-fitness')
  	```
5. (Optional) In order to better handle the right versions, add in your `android/build.gradle`:
  	```ext {
      // Other build versions
      fitnessPlayServices: "<Your version>" // default: 17.0.0
      authPlayServices: "<Your version>" // default: 17.0.0
    }
  	```

## Usage

```javascript
import Fitness from '@ovalmoney/react-native-fitness';

const permissions = [
  { kind: Fitness.PermissionKinds.Steps, access: Fitness.PermissionAccesses.Write },
];

Fitness.isAuthorized(permissions)
  .then((authorized) => {
    // Do something
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Do something
  });
```
### API

- **Fitness.isAuthorized([{ kind: int, access: int }])**
Check if permissions are granted or not. It works on Android and iOS >= 12.0, while it returns an error when iOS < 12.
It requires an `Array` of `Object` with a mandatory key `kind` and an optional key `access`.
Possible values for the keys can be found in `PermissionKinds` and `PermissionAccesses` under `Attributes` section.
On iOS at least one permissions with `Read` access must be provided, otherwise an `errorEmptyPermissions` will be thrown.

- **Fitness.requestPermissions([{ kind: int, access: int }])**
Ask permission and return if user granted or not(Android), while, due to Apple's privacy model, always true is returned in iOS.
It requires an `Array` of `Object` with a mandatory key `kind` and an optional key `access`.
Possible values for the keys can be found in `PermissionKinds` and `PermissionAccesses` under `Attributes` section.
On iOS at least one permissions with `Read` access must be provided, otherwise an `errorEmptyPermissions` will be thrown.
